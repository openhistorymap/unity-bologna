# Unity Bologna
The set of unitypackage collected here is derived from the Open Data exposed by the Municipality of Bologna in its open data portal(http://dati.comune.bologna.it/3d). 

We re-packaged the elements into several distinct unity packages with simple props (barrel, barrow, benches, Cloths) and some typically Bolognese buildings.
In addition to that, some of these buildings are already Buildr2 compatible and the fog is already Enviro ready
